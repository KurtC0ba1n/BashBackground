# Debian-Scripts
Some useful scripts to automate daily and basics tasks on Linux systems 

Make Debian great again with those scripts! As they are all different, each folders contain another README.md with useful informations about concerned tools. 

Those scripts have been created to run on Debian GNU/Linux with a Gnome interface, however, if your Linux distribution has the required systems/packages you can still run them. As you could see this repo is 100% made of Bash language, the goal is to keep this 100% to keep a maximum portability whithout having to install/compile other languages even when it gets really complex and could be done faster with other languages.   

Feel free to clone this Git repository in order to use thoses tools which can, either save you some time, either tune your distribution as long as your system can run the needed requirements or improve them as a lot can be improved.
